That looks like the login page for an "Exam Hall Seating Arrangement" web application! Based on the image and the project's likely purpose, here is a professional and comprehensive README.md file you can use.

Since the URL shows login_student.php, I'll assume it's a PHP/MySQL project, which is common for this type of application, and that it has both student and administrator interfaces.

Exam Hall Seating Arrangement System
üìù Overview
The Exam Hall Seating Arrangement System is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage and generate seating plans for examinations. It automates the complex and time-consuming process of assigning students to specific halls and seats, reducing manual errors and ensuring fairness and optimized room utilization.

This system provides distinct login portals for Students to view their allocated seating and for Administrators to manage student data, hall details, and generate the final seating arrangements.

‚ú® Features
Administrator Module
Student Management: Add, view, edit, and delete student records (e.g., name, registration number, course).

Hall Management: Define and configure examination halls (e.g., hall name, capacity, number of rows/columns).

Course/Exam Management: Define the courses and examinations for which seating needs to be arranged.

Automated Seating Generation: A core algorithm to automatically generate a fair and randomized seating arrangement based on student registration, course, and hall capacity constraints.

View & Publish Seating: Review the generated plan and publish it for students to view.

Reporting: Generate printable reports of the final seating plan for invigilators.

Student Module
Login Portal: Secure login using student credentials.

View Seating Details: Students can view their assigned Hall Number, Seat Number, and the Exam details upon successful login.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You will need a local web server environment that supports PHP and MySQL. We recommend using a package like XAMPP or WAMP/MAMP.

XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP

Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
Place the Project Folder:

Copy the entire project folder (Exam-Hall-Seating-Arrangement-main or similar) into your web server's root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP, www for WAMP).

Database Setup:

Open your web server's phpMyAdmin interface (usually at http://localhost/phpmyadmin).

Create a new database (e.g., exam_seating).

Import the provided database file (e.g., database.sql - assuming you have one) into the newly created database.

Configuration:

Navigate to the database connection file (e.g., config.php or db_connect.php) and update the database credentials if necessary (e.g., username, password, database name) to match your local setup.

Run the Application:

Start your Apache and MySQL services.

Open your web browser and navigate to the project's main URL:

http://localhost:8080/Exam-Hall-Seating-Arrangement-main
(Note: The port 8080 may vary depending on your server configuration).
